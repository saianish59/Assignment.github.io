Dear %%first_name%%,

The Executive Program in Management (EPM) is an intensive, nine-month, multi-modular general management, and leadership program that is aimed at helping leaders scale new heights in their careers.

Participants explore a wide variety of cutting-edge management practices and interact with world-renowned Columbia faculty, industry practitioners, and experienced peers in the classroom. Participants are given the opportunity to apply theories to practice, and will emerge from the Executive Program in Management as stronger and more focused leaders, better equipped to take the next step in their leadership journey.	

We are closely monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and will start with online sessions in October 2020 to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the entire community. The first on-campus module will take place from March 8–12, 2021 in New York City.
